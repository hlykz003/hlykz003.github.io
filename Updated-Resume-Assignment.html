                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a student at Code:You and brand new to all things 
                    coding. The most complicated tech project I have done to 
                    date is rooting an Android phone and I found that very 
                    challenging with no experience since it required the use 
                    of terminal commands. I actually ended up bricking the 
                    phone which made the project much more complicated! 
                    Regardless, that was a great learning experience. Ever 
                    since I was a kid, I always wanted to know how to build 
                    a website and thought that would be so cool. The child 
                    version of Hailey from 15 years ago would be so proud!

                    <p>
                        I am currently enrolled in the Code:You program. So 
                        far I have partially completed the Intro to Programming 
                        section, but after that is complete, I will be doing the 
                        web development pathway to learn how to design a website.

                    <h3>Food Science Technician - GE Appliances</h3>
                    <p>August 2023 - Present</p>
                    <p>
                        I work at GE Appliances under what we call our "Consumer
                        Testing Laboratory" where we test all types of kitchen 
                        appliances. This laboratory serves the purpose of testing 
                        new appliance models or existing ones with new features
                        added before they are rolled out for production. We use 
                        food tests (such as cakes and cookies) to verify that the 
                        appliance is working as it should. We evaluate the foods 
                        for sensory properties (color, texture, etc) and send the 
                        results to the engineer responsible for the appliance. Fun 
                        fact: GE Appliances is the only company who does this kind of
                        thorough consumer modeled testing on their appliances before 
                        being released to customers!

                        I made a very basic HTML site showing the template 
                        of what a recipe website with lists and procedures 
                        could look like as part of an assignment for Code:You.
